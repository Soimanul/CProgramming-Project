# Compiling

Compile both using gcc -o server server.c -lws2_32 and gcc -o client client.c -lws2_32 for Windows. Or remove the -lws2_32 flag for other Operating Systems.

## Running

run using ./server and ./client LAN  (client.c must have the right ip address of the server. To do so, replace your current Wireless LAN IPv4 Address in client.c )
